### 👋 Hi! I am Kirill

Senior Backend Engineer and Tech Lead with over a decade of experience building high-load distributed systems. My current technical focus is the intersection of robust Go-based architectures and AI, specifically implementing LLMs and agentic workflows into production environments.

I focus on building microservices that solve business problems and provide clear metrics for growth. My experience covers AdTech and real-time video, where I prioritize system reliability and clean, polished digital products.

I also have a long-term interest in sustainable ecology and exploring how AI can be applied to complex real-world systems. I’m currently looking for a new role where I can use my technical skills to build high-quality software within a forward-thinking team.
